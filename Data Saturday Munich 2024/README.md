###  üìä Demo Content

**Azure Data Explorer clusters can be created for free, without an Azure subscription!** I would HIGHLY recommend doing this to start experimenting with ADX and KQL: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/start-for-free-web-ui

You will be able to run the Monza23.kql queries against a Kusto DB created within Synapse Real-Time Analytics in Fabric or an Azure Data Explorer cluster, with local file ingestion used with the CSV provided. 
- Information on how to do this can be found here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/get-data-file

The queries for Entra ID log analysis have been provided under EntraID.kql, however the associated data is not available as this contains logs from a private tenant provided for private use. Entra ID logs can be extracted from your own tenant and used with the queries provided, so long as the table name which you have given your Kusto/ADX DB is amended. 
- Information on how to extract Entra ID sign-in logs can be found here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/howto-download-logs

I have included the .pbix file for the example PowerBI telemetry dashboard which I showed in the demo.
